To contribute to this wiki all you need to do is follow this handy little guide!
All of these steps require a [Github](https://github.com) account!

## First Step

There's two ways to do this:

If you just want to simply edit one of the existing pages you just click the <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> Edit this page in the top right of the page! Then skip to [Step 3](#third-step)

Or if you want to create a new section go to the [project](https://github.com/Bennyboy1695/ShadowNodeHugo/blob/master/content/wiki/) and click the `Fork` button.

## Second Step
*This step is only if you did the second option in the First Step*

Once you have clicked the fork button you will be redirected to your version of the github repo.
On there you must go into the content folder, this is where all of the posts on here are located.

Now you can create a new section by simply making a new folder, on github this is done in the edit screen which you can get to by clicking `Create new file`.
You then simply type what you want the folder to be named followed by a `/`.

If you want your new section follow the steps in [Step 3](#third-step) but inside a file called `_index.md` inside the folder!

## Third Step

This is where you now design your post.

If you created a new file you must put:
```
---
title: Contributing

---
```
at the top of the file, and the file must have `.md` at the end!

Then you just simply write everything in a language called Markdown. A guide of how things will look on our site can be seen [here](https://learn.netlify.com/en/cont/markdown/) of course we have a slightly different color scheme but the layout is the same!

## Fourth Step

Now you have edited/created your files you must use github to create a pull request to get them on the actual website.

To do this a handy guide can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
